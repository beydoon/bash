!!! WARNING !!!
This script will run immediatly in the current directory and alter the changes.
Run only if you know what you are doing.

This is a quick and dirty demo of using brace expansion to do the following:

 * change the file name to lower-case
 * replace spaces in the file name with underscores
 * print the result
 * commit the switch to new file name

### Instructions
Theres nothing to pass to the file. It will run collect all the file names in
the current directory, and will make the switch. So be very careful when
executing this script.

To run the script:
```
./filefix2lcau.sh
```
