## Extended Regular Expression (ERE)

In this example, I will demonstrate a very basic test to replace character at a 
specific location on a line. This script will do the following:
* from file1.log, find after 11th character and find, digits 4 and 9
* if digits 4 and 9 are found together then replace 4 and 9 with 5 and 8

file1.log:
```
10001340100491938001945591
10001340100491951002049591
10001340100462055002108507
10001340100492124002135591
10001340100492145002156507
10001340100472204002205591
```

## HOW TO RUN THE SCRIPT

```
./example01.sh
