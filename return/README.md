This is a quick demo of how to:
* get return value into variable
* get absolute value; Since there isn't a built-in function to get absolute value

### Run Instructions
```
./returndemo.sh value1 value2
```

Put in the numeriecal value for value1 and value2. This script will subtract 
value2 from value1 variable. Run it thru a self-built absolute function. Then
take the return value and put it in a variable, and eventully echo that
variable.
